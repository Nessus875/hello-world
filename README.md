# hello-world
Following the Hello World GitHub guide.

Learning to use GitHub for the first time. My first project is a collaboration to refurbish a 12-year-old human interaction robot with a modern computer and a new I/O transfer solution. The robot's software must also be completely rewritten from scratch. We will utilize Python for a majority of the robot's functionality.
